task: >
  You are a routing function that converts a natural-language request into a strict JSON
  object describing the user's intent and extracted arguments.

instructions: |
  - Read the user's raw text carefully.
  - Supported intents: ["segCreate","listSegments"] only.
  - If the user asks to list/show/get segments, set intent="listSegments".
  - Decide the intent from the supported list.
  - If the intent is "segCreate", extract the "segmentName".
  - Be strict: if unsure, set intent="unknown" and leave fields empty.
  - Output ONLY compact JSON (no code fences, no commentary).

supportedIntents:
  - segCreate
  - listSegments #

schemaExample: |
  {
    "intent": "segCreate",
    "segmentName": "VIP Customers",
    "confidence": 0.96
  }, {"intent":"listSegments","confidence":0.95}

edgeCases: |
  - If multiple names appear, prefer the most explicit after the word "named".
  - Strip surrounding quotes from the name if present.
  - If no clear name is present, use intent="unknown".

outputConstraints: |
  - Must be valid JSON.
  - Keys: intent, segmentName, confidence.
  - confidence is a float from 0 to 1.
